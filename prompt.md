I am creating a app for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This app features a dashboard that allows users to monitor and control their industrial equipment such as sensors, PLCs, robots, etc.

This app allows companies to provide support to their customers for their industrial equipment by collecting data from the equipment and analyzing it to provide insights and recommendations.

Your task is to build an incredible marketing homepage for this app. I want it to be creative and unique. Really push the limits of your design capabilities.

You have an empty directory here, I want you to initialize a project with the following specs:

- Vite
- Tailwind
- React
- TypeScript
- Bun

Once initialized, I want you to create FIVE different designs. Each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create. They should be hosted on /1, /2, /3, /4 and /5 respectively.

Use your frontend design skill to make these designs exceptional.
